This repository will contain all the files for the open source class project\
Project Topic:Movie Collection\
Overall Description:\
We wanted to create this App because with agree that is a great way to familiarize with PHP and Data Bases, it also let us implement CRUD functions. Lastly, we think that a movie collection app is interesting to make.\
App Functions:\
Create: Add new movies to the collection.\
Read: View a list of all movies.\
Update: Edit movie details like rating, genre, or description.\
Delete: Remove movies from the collection.\
Search and Filter Options: Implement advanced search and filter options (e.g., by genre, year, rating, etc.). Allow users to sort the movie list by different criteria (e.g., release date, rating).\
App Goal:\
Users can have their personal movie collection where they can rate the movies, select if they already watched or not and also organize it by different criteria\
