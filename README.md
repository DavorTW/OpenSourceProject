# OpenSourceProject
This repository will contain all the files for the open source class project.\
Project Topic: Movie Collection\
Overall Description:\
We wanted to create this app because we agree that is a great way to familiarize ourselves with PHP and Data Bases, it also lets us implement CRUD functions. Lastly, we think that a movie collection app is interesting to make.\
App Functions:\
Create: Add new movies to the collection.\
Read: View a list of all movies.\
Update: Edit movie details like rating, genre, or description.\
Delete: Remove movies from the collection.\
Search and Filter Options: Implement advanced search and filter options (e.g., by genre, year, rating, etc.). Allow users to sort the movie list by different criteria. (e.g., release date, rating).\
App Goal:\
Users can have their personal movie collection where they can rate the movies, select if they had or hadn't already watched specific movies and also organize them by different criteria.\
